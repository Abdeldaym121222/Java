// Variables
    Variables are used to store data in a program. To declare a variable is to tell the compiler
    what type of data a variable can hold.

   data_type  variable_name = value;

	int  age = 25;
	float avg = 243.6f;
	String str = "hello";
	final float pi = 3.14; // constant variable
